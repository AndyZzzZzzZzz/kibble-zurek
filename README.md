# Coherent Annealing: Kibble-Zurek Simulation on a QPU

A demonstration of using the 
[fast-anneal protocol](https://docs.dwavesys.com/docs/latest/c_qpu_annealing.html) 
on a quantum processing unit (QPU) to simulate the formation of topological defects 
in a 1D ring of spins undergoing a phase transition, as described by the 
[Kibble-Zurek mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibble%E2%80%93Zurek_mechanism).

This example anneals an Ising problem in the coherent regime, producing results 
predicted for your configured anneal duration.

## <a name="The-Kibble-Zurek-Mechanism"></a> The Kibble-Zurek Mechanism

For a system driven through a [phase transition](#Phase-Transitions), the 
Kibble-Zurek mechanism relates the formation of 
[topological defects](#Topological-Defects) to the transition speed. 

### <a name="Phase-Transitions"></a> Phase Transitions

Some macroscopic phase transitions are familiar: liquid water to solid ice, 
metal to magnet. 

![Phase Transitions](assets/phase_transitions.png)

The material switches between **disorderly** and **orderly** states: 

*   Magnet/Non-magnet: aligned microscopic magnetic domains versus random orientations 
*   Ice/Water: crystalline structure versus ongoing formation and breaking of 
    hydrogen bonds. 

### <a name="Topological-Defects"></a> Topological Defects

Kibble originally formulated the mechanism to explain the transition of the 
hot post-Big Bang universe from highly symmetric to the current cool and 
expanding state, with its galaxies of stars and planets.  

![Universe](assets/universe.png)

Zurek expanded the idea to condensed matter and quantum phase transitions.   

A one-dimensional ferromagnetic/anti-ferromagnetic ring of spins undergoing 
quantum annealing is an example of a quantum phase transition.

![Ising J=1](assets/ising.png)

A fast anneal (a "quench") transitions the system from a phase of superposition 
of its spins to a state of alternating groups of spins, some up and some down. 
Switches from one group to the next are called "kinks".

### Kink Density

The mechanism relates the density of topological defects (kinks) from 
continuous or quantum phase transitions to the quench time as a universal 
scaling law.

Consider two extreme cases:

1. **Ideal adiabatic transition**. 

![!D Spin Ring Adiabatic](assets/1D_adiabatic.png)

At the end of a very long anneal, it ends in one of two ground states:
all spins up or all spins down.

2. **Instantaneous quench**.

![!D Spin Ring Instantaneous](assets/1D_instantaneous.png)

Each spin is independently oriented up or down.

In between these two extremes, for finite quenches, the system ends in a state 
of alternating groups of spins, some up and some down. The length of these
groups increases with the quench time. For the case of a 1D ring of spins, it 
increases as a function of the square root of the anneal time.

## <a name="Installation"></a> Installation

You can run this example without installation in cloud-based IDEs that support 
the [Development Containers specification](https://containers.dev/supporting)
(aka "devcontainers").

For development environments that do not support ``devcontainers``, install 
requirements:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

If you are cloning the repo to your local system, working in a 
[virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is 
recommended.

## <a name="Usage"></a> Usage

Your development environment should be configured to 
[access Leapâ€™s Solvers](https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/overview/sapi.html).
You can see information about supported IDEs and authorizing access to your 
Leap account [here](https://docs.dwavesys.com/docs/latest/doc_leap_dev_env.html).  

To run the demo:

```bash
python app.py
```

Access the user interface with your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8050/.

The demo program opens an interface where you can configure 
problems, submit these problems to a quantum computer, and compare the results
to the Kibble-Zurek predictions.

## <a name="Code"></a> Code

Most the code related to configuring and analyzing the Ising problem is in the
[helpers/qa.py](helpers/qa.py) and [helpers/kz_calcs.py](helpers/kz_calcs.py) 
files. The remaining files mostly support the user interface.

**Note:** Standard practice for submitting problems to Leap solvers is to use
a [dwave-system](https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/docs_system/sdk_index.html)
sampler; for example, you typically use
[DWaveSampler](https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/docs_system/reference/samplers.html)
for Ising problems. The code in this example uses the
[dwave-cloud-client](https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/docs_cloud/sdk_index.html),
which enables finer control over communications with the Solver API (SAPI).

If you are learning to submit problems to Leap solvers, use a ``dwave-system``
solver, with its higher level of abstraction and thus greater simplicity,
as demonstrated in most the code examples of the
[example collection](https://github.com/dwave-examples) and in the
[Ocean documentation](https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/index.html).
